## Enterprise-Grade Flight Booking ETL Pipeline with Delta Lake & SCD
### Project Status: In Progress 🚧
This repository contains an end-to-end Data Engineering project focused on building an enterprise-grade ETL pipeline for flight booking data using Databricks Lakehouse architecture.
The project is currently under active development.

### Project Overview
The goal of this project is to design and implement a scalable, analytics-ready data pipeline that ingests raw flight booking data, applies transformations, handles incremental updates, and maintains historical data using Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD).
The pipeline is built following modern data engineering best practices, including dimensional modeling and Delta Lake optimizations.
